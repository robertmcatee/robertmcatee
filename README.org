* Hi there
I am a software engineering leader with experience working in the banking, and government sectors.

Based in San Antonio, Texas, I currently serve as Director of Information Technology for a court within the federal judiciary of the United States where I work to bring the digital transformation to the administration of justice.

My interests include literate programming, declarative configuration, and container orchestration.
